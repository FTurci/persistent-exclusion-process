# Persistent Exclusion Process


This is a `Python` and `C` implementation of the persistent exclusion process (see [Sepulveda and Soto PRL 2017](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.078001)), using `ctypes`.

In the folder `src` one can find all the code and the Makefile.

To compile, just do

```
cd src
make
```
